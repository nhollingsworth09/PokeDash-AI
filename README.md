# PokeDash-AI: An Artificial Intelligence Experiment

## Introduction
After completing an introductory course into Deep Learning, I finally had a basic understanding sufficient enough to start a this project that I've been itching to do for a while. The challenge is simple: "Can I create an neural network that can learn to play a game?"

The first few weeks of 2019 was spent learning how to use [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), an Open Source python package allowing user to design and build multimedia applications such as games. At the beginning of June, I gave myself two weeks to build the game then train a reinforcement learning algoritm ontop of it. The results are below.
